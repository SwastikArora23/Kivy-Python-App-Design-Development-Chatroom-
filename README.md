Kivy is a multi-platform GUI development library for Python, running on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS. The idea is, you can build an app in one locaiton, and use it across basically all devices. It's a super cool idea, but...only if it works. The last time I tried Kivy, I had a hard time getting it to run on Android, which shouldn't be too hard. We'll see how it goes this time!

To get Kivy, it really depends on your operating system. Head to Kivy.org, then go to download, then follow the instructions for what you'll be using. It's just a series of commands you need to run, so pause the video and get that done.

Next, like many things, I think it's best we just jump in without any further explanation. You know what Kivy is and why it could be awesome, now let's see what we can find.
